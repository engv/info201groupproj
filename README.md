# Project Description
- What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.
We will be working with the Johnson IPIP-NEO data, created by John Anthony Johnson.
- Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset.  You should hone in on one of these audiences.
Our target audience for this project would be those who have taken the personality test, and those who are interested in learning more about the distribution of different personality traits.
- What does your audience want to learn from your data?  Please list out at least 3 specific questions that your project will answer for your audience.
Questions:
1. What personality traits are common in certain parts of the world in comparison to where I live?
2.
3.

# Technical Description
- How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)?
We will read in our data using a .json file.
- What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?
We will need to reshape, reformat, and flatten the raw data in order to make it easier to work with.
- What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)
We will be using the shiny library as well as either ggplot2 or plotly.
- What major challenges do you anticipate?
Interpreting the data may be a challenge, as the raw data looks confusing and doesn't give any obvious information.
