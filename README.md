# Project Description

We will be working with the _Johnson IPIP-NEO_ data, a public 120-item and 300-item representation of the NEO Personality Inventory that was created by John Anthony Johnson. The **IPIP** is an international non-profit organization that compiles personality data around the world. We aim for our target audience to be those who have either already taken the personality test, and those who are interested in learning more about the distribution of different personality traits regarding the NEO Personality Inventory.

**Questions:**
1. What personality traits are common in certain parts of the world in comparison to where I live?
2. Where are the overlaps or commonalities between two or more different personality types?
3. How might filtering by gender reveal differences in common personality traits?

# Technical Description
In order to read in our data, we will be using a _.json_ file. In terms of data-wrangling, we will need to reshape, reformat, and flatten the raw data in order to make it easier to work with and readable. We expect to be using the _shiny library_ as well as either _ggplot2_ or _plotly_. As for anticipating future bottlenecks, interpreting the raw data may be a challenge, as the raw data format is a little confusing and doesn't reveal obvious information. Also, missing information in each column might challenging to work around.
